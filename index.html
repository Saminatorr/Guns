                        <p>
                            Guns. They are fascinating right? Over 75 people per 100 have a gun in America.
                            That means more then 270 million civilians have a fire arm. Each year they have approximately 31.000 gun incidents where
                            many people have been attacked by some kind of pistol. But where do guns come from? What are their roots?

                        <h3>Firework</h3>
                        <p>
                            It all started with the chinese. They were the first to invent gunpowder which is used to fire a gun.
                            However, they didn't start with a gun we see today. They started out with a simple barrel of
                            bamboo which was used for fireworks. But the bamboo was not strong enough and they made a metal barrel
                            together with projectiles that fit perfectly. And without knowing, they made a gun. All it takes is
                            gunpowder, a barrel and a projectile.
