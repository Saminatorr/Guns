                            That means more then 270 million civilians have a fire arm. Each year they have approximately 31.000 gun incidents where
                            many people have been attacked by some kind of pistol.
                            In the world of today, having a gun is nothing special. It is even normal.

                        <h3>Firework</h3>
                        <p>
                            It all started with the Chinese. They were the first to invent gunpowder which is used to fire a gun.
                            However, they didn't start with a gun we see today. They started out with a simple barrel of
                            bamboo which was used for fireworks. This was long before 1300 but it was not popular untill this age.
                            Unfortunately the bamboo was not strong enough and so they made a metal barrel
                            together with projectiles that fit perfectly. And without knowing, they made a gun. All it takes is
                            gunpowder, a barrel and a projectile.

                        <h3>Fuse</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the beginning, guns were fired with a fuse. The spark was transferred untill
                            it reached the gunpowder and then boom. Or they held a torch near the gunpowder and it exploded just like that.
                            But still, it was not very effective if you were staring your enemy in the eye. You always had to have one hand free.
                            So that's where the matchlock mechanism came in. The design removed the need of one hand in order to fire the gun.
                            It basically just put a fuse on your gun.

                        <h3>Bullets</h3>
                        <p>
                            During the 1500s they realised round bullets were a little bit unhandy to load in to their gun.
                            They had to put gunpowder in the barrel, then put the bullet in, and then push it all together.
                            This was very time consuming if you were fighting a war.
                            That's why they invented the paper cartridge. It is a type of ammunition
                            packaging a bullet together with the gunpowder. They also invented rifling, which are grooves in the barrel
                            to make the projectile spin and make it more accurate.

                        <p>
                            Thanks to the rifling technique guns are way more accurate then before. But another technique that also improved
                            accuracy was the use of sights. A 'uitsteeksel' on the far end of the barrel aligned by eye with a notch at the
                            base of the barrel made the sight complete. When everyhting was aligned this system provided all the accuracy
                            required for a good shot. In this age they also invented the flintlock.
                            It was a new system simular to the matchlock but way better.

                            In the 1600s they only had simple iron sights. But today there are a lot of different sights
                            and each one has its own purpose. Let's take a look at a few.

                            In the 1600s the French invented the bayonet but only in the 1700s it was used by other countries.
                            It was a simple long blade and they put it on to the guns end.
                            Next to that, the duelling pistols became very popular. They were so favoured that they replaced
                            the carrying of a sword or a knife. This happened around 1750.
                            A few years later they became officially standarized weapons. It was a rule that they should be
                            nine or ten inch long with the flintlock system carrying a ball of 48 pound.

                            The breechloading concept developed in the late 1800s led to a very important advantage. Speed of loading.
                            Next to that, they also thought of multiple chambers for multiple shots. They also invented the slide
                            technique, the so called repeating rifle.
                            Around that same time they also wanted to make a gun that fires rounds quickly so they
                            came up with the gatling gun.
                            A gun with several barrels that turned and fired when a man turned its crank while his partner
                            fed the gun with ammunition.



                            <!--During the 1800s they invented the gatling gun.
                            This is a gun with several barrels. A man had to turn its crank and his assistant had to feed the ammunition.
                            At the late 1880s, the first successful full-auto machine fun, which fires continuously while the
                            trigger was held back, was perfected and adopted by several armies.
                            The winchester was also a popular gun in the 1800s. It was one of the first repeating guns. That means that
                            the gun holds more then one bullet and can be fired more than once between chargings.-->

                        <h3>Advanced weaponry</h3>
                        <p>
                            A lot happened during the 1900s. Several wars and battles were fought throughout the century.
                            Therefor they had the need for better and more advanced weapons.
                            Thus they invented the first automatic rifle in the early 1900s.
                            It fired continuously when the trigger was held back.
                            They also came to the idea of sub machine guns and assault rifles.
                            Sub machine for in close combat, assault rifles for longer range but also for close combat if nessecary.
                            Next to that, grenades, flamethrowers and mortars became introduced as well.

                        <h3>Combat vehicles</h3>
                        <p>
                            During World War One, armourd vehicles were first deployed. There was one problem though,
                            they required smooth terein to move upon and thus
                            new developments were needed: the tank,
                            the same as an armoured car but it could move across all terain.
                            The tank was not very effetive untill the second World War where it became very important.
                            During WW1 it was also the first time that aircrafts were used on a large scale.
                            In the beginning they were mostly used
                            reconnaissance but after a while pilots also learned how to shoot and drop bombs.

                        <h3>Robots</h3>
                        <p>
                            Starting in 1900, weaponry got very advanced very quickly. Tanks, fighter jets, grenades, snipers, flashbangs, ...
                            But also on larger scale like missiles and nuclear bombs. 1900 was a century full of surprises and even today new
                            technologies are made. Super high-tech sights, corner guns that can shoot around a corner, ...
                            Technology keeps growing and we don't know what will come next. We don't know what
                            the future will bring. Drones already exist, it's only a matter of time that soldiers will be robots too.
