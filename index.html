                        <p>
                            Guns. They are fascinating right? Over 75 people per 100 have a gun in America.
                            That means more then 270 million civilians have a fire arm. Each year they have approximately 31.000 gun incidents where
                            many people have been attacked by some kind of pistol. But where do guns come from? What are their roots?

                        <h3>Firework</h3>
                        <p>
                            It all started with the Chinese. They were the first to invent gunpowder which is used to fire a gun.
                            However, they didn't start with a gun we see today. They started out with a simple barrel of
                            bamboo which was used for fireworks. But the bamboo was not strong enough and they made a metal barrel
                            together with projectiles that fit perfectly. And without knowing, they made a gun. All it takes is
                            gunpowder, a barrel and a projectile.

                        <h3>Fuse - matchlock</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the beginning, guns were fired with a fuse. The spark was transferred untill
                            it reached the gunpowder and then boom. Or they held a torch near the gunpowder and it exploded just like that.
                            But still, it was not very effective if you were staring your enemy in the eye. You always had to have one hand free.
                            So that's where the matchlock mechanism came in. The design removed the need of one hand in order to fire the gun. 
                            It basically just put a fuse on your gun.

                        <p>
                            During the 1500s they realised round bullets were a little bit unhandy to load in to their gun.
                            They had to put gunpowder in the barrel, then put the bullet in, and then push it all together.
                            This was very time consuming if you were fighting a war.
                            That's why they invented the paper cartridge. It is a type of ammunition
                            packaging a bullet together with the gunpowder. They also invented rifling, which are grooves in the barrel
                            to make the projectile spin and make it more accurate.

                        <p>
                            Thanks to the rifling technique guns are way more accurate then before. But another technique that also improved
                            accuracy was the use of sights. A 'uitsteeksel' on the far end of the barrel aligned by eye with a notch at the
                            base of the barrel made the sight complete. When everyhting was aligned this system provided all the accuracy
                            required for a good shot. In this age they also invented the flintlock.
                            It was a new system simular to the matchlock but way better.

                        <p>
                            In the 1600s the French invented the bayonet but only in the 1700s it was used by other countries.
                            It was a simple long blade and they put it on to the guns end.
                            Next to that, the duelling pistols became very popular. They were so favoured that they replaced
                            the carrying of a sword or knife. This happened around 1750.
                            A few years later they became officially standarized weapons. It was a rule that they should be
                            nine or ten inch long with the flintlock system carrying a ball of 48 pound.
